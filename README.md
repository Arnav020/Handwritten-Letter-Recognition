# Handwritten Letter Recognition Model

A deep learning model for recognizing handwritten letters using the EMNIST dataset, implemented with TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn.

## Features
- Trained on the EMNIST dataset for high accuracy.
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction.
- Implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for comparison.
- Generates accuracy metrics and confusion matrices for performance evaluation.

## Dataset
The model uses the **EMNIST** dataset, a variant of the MNIST dataset that includes handwritten letters.

## Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for feature extraction.
- **Fully Connected Layers** for classification.
- **KNN & SVM models** for benchmarking.

## Results
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices.
- Performance comparisons between CNN, KNN, and SVM.
